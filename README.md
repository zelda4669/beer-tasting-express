## Overview

The current version of this app displays a list of craft breweries. The app displays the brewery name, location, and allows the user to select whether or not they have tasted it. Eventually, this app will allow users to save tasting notes about craft beers and lookup information about the breweries. Placeholder functions have been created for beer and user info, but the logic hasn't been written yet.

The front end of the app is built using React. The repo for the front end can be found [here](https://github.com/zelda4669/beer-tasting-frontend).

## Tools Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- [Morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan) for logging
- MongoDB
- ESLint

## Learnings

I am building similar applications concurrently in Node/Express and [Python/Django](https://github.com/zelda4669/beer-tasting) . Django was my first web framework, and it has been a much different experience to work in an unopinionated framework like Express. Building these applications in parallel is really helping me develop a stronger understanding of how web apps work on the backend and best practices for designing backends.

## Next Steps

- ~~Build React frontend~~
- Build out endpoints for beer info
- Develop user authentication
- Build out endpoints for user notes
