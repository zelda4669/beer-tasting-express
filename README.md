## Overview

Currently, the app saves basic information about breweries to a MongoDB and fetches the information to be displayed as a JSON file. Currently, only the backend has been developed. The front end will be built next using React. Placeholders have been created for beer and user info, but the logic hasn't been written yet.

## Tools Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- [Morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan) for logging
- MongoDB
- ESLint

## Learnings

I am building similar applications concurrently in Node/Express and [Python/Django](https://github.com/zelda4669/beer-tasting) . Django was my first web framework, and it has been a much different experience to work in an unopinionated framework like Express. Building these applications in parallel is really helping me develop a stronger understanding of how web apps work on the backend and best practices for designing backends.

## Next Steps

- Build React frontend
- Build out endpoints for beer info
- Develop user authentication
- Build out endpoints for user notes
